HOW TO USE:
-----------
1. Load Tab:
   - Click "Load Spectrum" to import your XPS data.
   - Make sure to set the correct photon energy.
   - You can reload or clear data using the relevant buttons.

2. Smoothing Tab:
   - Apply optional smoothing filters to clean up noisy spectra.

3. Background Tab:
   - Select a region for background fitting.
   - Choose the model (e.g., Shirley or linear) and apply subtraction.

4. Fit Tab:
   - Add peak components manually.
   - Fit the spectrum using constraints and visualize results.

5. General Utility Tab:
   - Load and store up to 6 different spectra.
   - Add photon energy per file.
   - Select files to compare (with or without normalization).
   - Click “Send to Analysis” to push a selected spectrum into the main workflow.

TIPS:
-----
- Make sure to save your work regularly.
- Hover over plot areas to see coordinates.
- Double-check photon energy values before analysis.
